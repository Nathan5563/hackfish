## Overview

**hackfish** is an open source chess engine written in C. It is designed to be easy to simple, efficient, and modular. I developed this engine to learn more about chess programming, drawing inspiration from Bluefever Softwareâ€™s [Chess Engine in C](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ1QII7yudbc-Ky058TEaOstZHVbT-2hg) YouTube series.

## Features

- Efficient C-based implementation with a 120 integer array
- Support for standard chess rules including castling, en passant, and the fifty move rule
- Command-line interface for interaction and testing

## Installation

To install Hackfish, clone the repository and compile the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/Nathan5563/hackfish.git
cd hackfish
make
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the Hackfish engine from the command line:

```
./hackfish
```

## Contributing

I welcome contributions from anyone interested in improving the program. If you have a bug report, feature request, or code contribution, please open an issue or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository.
